This little Python script triggers a alert for your nearest bus stop (the ZTM url needs to be updated for a different bus and bus stop.

When the button on the Raspberry Pi is pushed, a message is sent via the chosen twitter account (to be changed in the code).

For the script to work, you also need to insert the Consumer key, Consumer secret, Access token and Access token secret (via Twitter developer tools)
